## When to use this?

In case your organization does not allow you to prototype a bot with the official bot framework or it just takes to long to get it set up this way.
In this case a fast prototype could be done with this hacky way.

Register for a Teams Account in case you do not have one.
Set Username/Password as secret.
Start the bot.
